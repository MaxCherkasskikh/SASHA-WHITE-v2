She will help you find your inner gift and talents, help you understand how to make better decisions in life, help you find out the personality of your children and how to leverage that to their benefit and advantage and how to find your perfect better half in life. My spouse and I are already expecting a child... Something we wish for everyone. Thank you, Dobriasha!</p>

Sasha's incredible knowledge and natural feel for people left me absolutely speechless. I would definitely recomend anyone to work with her if you need help understanding your own potential, abilities and strengths. She will really show you a simple way out of your issues and you won't even believe how close the answer and the remedy to your worries are.</p>

At this point in your life it's hard to find support and it's a huge obstacle just to start fighting again for your goals and priorities. I needed help in my life and Sasha, being a good friend of mine gave me guidance and a new perspective on life. I was able to open up my own business and have the life style that I always wanted and I couldn't do it without the support that Sasha gave me in that moment. I truly love you Sasha. You are an amazing human being. Your energy and knowledge can change the world into a better place. And I believe that it will!</p>

But Sasha has revealed a totally new and profound concept of "me" to myself. She compartmentalized all of my talents and dissolved a ton of hidden fears. I have always though that I needed to make a hard career choice between being a producer or a screen writer. But she has helped me to understand that the two can co-exist in my life and that I have the gift for it. How can one continue to be an unbeliever? She also helped me understand why I make certain decisions in regards to emotions, relationships and even diet. And it's been mindblowing and something I am recommending to everyone. If you are ready to open the book called "Self - A Manual For Life" than Sasha welcomes you!</p>

Sasha loaded me with a ton of positive energy and love for this city and helped me to fall in love with it from the getgo. After that, for a while, I lived with the thought and desire that I want to move here at some point. And two and a half years later I bought a one-way ticket to LA. Sasha is a strongly energetic person and people are drawn to her. She has strong motivational abilities and has the knowledge to help one understand themselves better. If you are at crossroads and need a good kick in the ass, Dobriasha is your girl!</p>

But I met with her we did a complete break down of my whole family and it was mind blowing. I want my children to be successful in applying their gifts in life. The break down Sasha gave me helped me to understand how my family and I operate. It has helped me to minimize bad decision making in the upbringing and educational process of my children. The way Sasha broke down the information about ourselves and our loved ones was truly magical. I am immensely grateful to her for that!</p>

I've known Sasha for more than 5 years now and every time I see her she motivates me to a better life. Her constant motivation completely changed my view on life. All the things she talked about opened up my eyes and my mindset. She helped me to understand that “The world is full of negativity and that we don’t have to be negative to ourselves. Our mindset and attitude can be controlled by us. We should think positive and be greatful to everyone and everything. We should choose actions that are in our best interests”. Sasha you are the best motivational coach ever!</p>
